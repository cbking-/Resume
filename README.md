# Corbin King's Resume

Utilizes [iText7](https://itextpdf.com/en/products/itext-7/itext-7-core) and its addon [pdfHTML](https://itextpdf.com/en/products/itext-7/convert-html-css-to-pdf-pdfhtml) to generate a PDF of my resume.

I find HTML and CSS a lot nicer to work with and get the document style that I want than using Word or similar document editor.

This was initally using [mPDF](https://mpdf.github.io/) because I had used it at T. H. Plastics but I wasn't a fan of being dependent on PHP .
