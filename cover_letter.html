Mr. Holzhauer,

<p>
    I am submitting my resume for the Web/Software Developer position you sent via email. I have experience as a developer in a medium sized company and would like to continue to grow my skills as a developer.  
</p>

<p>
    At my previous position, I was the only developer on a team of four. This required me to be self-directed and responsible for applications from design to deployment. The projects that I worked on included several browser-based applications using PHP and ASP.NET MVC (C#). With all applications or scripts I wrote, I used Git to maintain proper source control. 
</p>

<p>
    I enjoy challenges and projects that require me to work outside my comfort and knowledge set. Continously learning new languages and development techniques is very important to me as it prevents stagnation and broadens the mind. 
</p>

<p>
    Attached is my resume which outlines my experience in many programming and scripting languages as well as other professional experience. I can be reached anytime via my cell phone or email listed above.
</p> 

<p>
    Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to speaking with you about this opportunity.
</p>

Sincerely,<br>
Corbin King
